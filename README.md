- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabagool-dot-eth, Information Token summoner and on-chain sleuth.
- 👀 Information Token is a collective of researchers and investors exploring the bleeding edge of decentralized finance, NFTs and web3. Information Token invests based on data, values, and gut feelings.
- 💞️ My goal is to develop IT as a trusted institutiuon within the crypto community. As a DAO, IT will operate in partnership with projects and founders who share our values (transparency, honesty, curiosity). IT will invest for profit, and to support proects that will allow DeFi to mature. 
  -  We will support public goods, publishing research & educational materials.
  - Internally, we develop custom tools, pool capital, iterate investing strategies and sign deals via an investment entity registered in the BVI.
  - IT will generate wealth for individual IT holders, grow the IT treasury, and enable talented individuals to pursue a new sort of career in the collective spaces where our digital futures are being shaped.  
  - I am developing an ecosystem tracker to idenitify, tag, and track the progress of emerging DeFi and NFT protocols, hackathon projects, and technologies. We will find, tag, and keep track of whatever comes after DeFi 2.0.
- 📫 Please reach out, I love to meet people who share my passion for DeFi, shitposting, and our favorite pain in the ass solution to everything ever: decentralized governance.
